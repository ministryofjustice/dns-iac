This repository aims to hold most of the Ministry of Justice's DNS estate.

This repository currently manages the following domains:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tracked</th>
      <th>Hosted Zone</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
{% for zone in tracked_zones %}
    <tr>
      <td align="center">:white_check_mark:</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/dns-iac/blob/main/terraform/{{ zone }}.tf">{{ zone }}</a></td>
    </tr>
{% endfor %}
{% for zone in untracked_zones %}
    <tr>
      <td align="center">:x:</td>
      <td>{{ zone }}</td>
    </tr>
{% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

## Scripts

### Fetch CloudWatch Metrics

The aim of this script is to provide information on the number of DNS queries made for a particular hosted zone over a specified time period.

This information can the be used to help determine whether or not it's safe to decommission a domain. It's worth noting that this information is only for **new** DNS queries for a domain, and does not account for any domain fetched from the cache on the resolver server, as this falls outside the available metrics for Route53.

#### Example Usage

```
python3 fetch-cloudwatch-metrics.py -z <Hosted Zone ID> -d 60
```

For more information on optional perameters for the script, run:

```
python3 fetch-cloudwatch-metrics.py -h
```
